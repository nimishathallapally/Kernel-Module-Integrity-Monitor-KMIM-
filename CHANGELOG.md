## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial release of KMIM
- Comprehensive kernel module integrity monitoring
- Rich color-coded CLI interface
- eBPF-based kernel module event tracking

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-05

### Added
- **Core Features**
  - Baseline creation and management for kernel modules
  - Real-time integrity scanning and comparison
  - SHA256 hash-based module verification
  - Syscall table address monitoring (468+ x64 syscalls)
  - Hidden module detection capabilities

- **Enhanced CLI Interface**
  - Rich color-coded output with professional formatting
  - Dual output modes (simple text + detailed tables)
  - Four main commands: `baseline`, `scan`, `show`, `syscalls`
  - Comprehensive help system with examples
  - Status-based color indicators for quick assessment

- **Advanced Analysis Features**
  - Compiler information extraction from ELF headers
  - ELF section analysis (.text, .data, .rodata, etc.)
  - Module metadata collection (size, address, path)
  - Truncated hash display for readability
  - Full hash verification for security

- **eBPF Implementation**
  - Kernel module load/unload event monitoring
  - Ring buffer-based efficient data transfer
  - Tracepoint attachment for module events
  - Modern libbpf-based implementation
  - Comprehensive build system with Makefile

- **Development Tools**
  - Professional Makefile with multiple targets
  - eBPF compilation and validation
  - Syntax checking and object analysis
  - VS Code IntelliSense configuration
  - Comprehensive test suite

- **Documentation**
  - Complete man page documentation
  - Technical implementation report
  - Professional README with examples
  - Color coding system documentation
  - Installation and usage guides

### Technical Details
- **Language**: Python 3.8+ with C eBPF components
- **Dependencies**: Rich library for CLI, libbpf for eBPF
- **Platform**: Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04+)
- **Privileges**: Requires root access for kernel inspection
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, efficient event processing

### Security Features

- Secure baseline storage with integrity protection
- Cryptographic hash verification (SHA256)
- Syscall table integrity monitoring
- Hidden module detection and reporting

### Architecture
- Modular Python CLI with rich formatting
- eBPF kernel programs for real-time monitoring
- JSON-based baseline storage format
- Professional error handling and reporting
- Extensible design for future enhancements
